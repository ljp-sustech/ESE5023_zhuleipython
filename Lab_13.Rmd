# 1. Environment Variables

An *environment variable* is a dynamic-named value containing information about your login session, set configuration options, and customize the shell environment in Linux-based operating systems. In simple terms, an environment variable is used to define a location for storing a value, you can also refer to its symbolic name. These values are stored within the system and are used by command-line applications. The stored value can be deleted, displayed, edited, and re-saved.

**2.1** Use `printenv` to print all environment variables.

**2.2** You can set a temporary environment variable by:

```{bash, eval=F}
MY_NAME=TAIYI
```

Then call this variable as `$MY_NAME`, for example:

```{bash, eval=F}
echo $MY_NAME
```

Notice that the above environment variables are available only for the current session. If you open a new shell, or if you log out, all variables will be lost. 

Please verify this.

**2.3** Setting a Persistent Environment Variable

One way to set a persistent environment variable is to use the user-based configuration file `.bash_profile` in your home directory. With Bash, you can declare the variables in the following format:

```{bash, eval=F}
export MY_NAME=TAIYI
```

Please add the above line to your `.bash_profile`, then save `.bash_profile`.

To update current environment variables, run:

```{bash, eval=F}
source .bash_profile
```

Now, we have made `$MY_NAME` a persistent environment variable, and it will be loaded every time you log in.

# 2. `Python` MPI job submission

This demo provides an example of submitting a simple *Message Passing Interface* (MPI) job using `Python`, and in particular, the `mpi4py` module. MPI is a standard protocol that defines how messages are passed between processes, including one-to-one and broadcast communications. Here we will use the `mpi4py` module that allows point-to-point (sends, receives) and collective (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of any picklable `Python` object, as well as optimized communications of `Python` object exposing the single-segment buffer interface (`NumPy` arrays, builtin bytes/string/array objects). Check [MPI for Python](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more.

**2.1** Installing `mpi4py` on your home folder

By far the easiest way to install `mpi4py` is using Anaconda, which will also install dependencies (including MPI). To do so, let's first load Anaconda on Taiyi, type the following line in your terminal:

```{bash, eval=F}
module load python/anaconda3/5.2.0
```

Now you should be able to use the `conda` command. We then create a new environment (e.g., `my_mpi`) and install `mpi4py` and other modules under `my_mpi`:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda create --name my_mpi python=3.8 mpi4py numpy scipy
```

Please refer to [`Python` environments](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/Section_11.html#Python_environments) for questions about the `conda` environment and how to create one.

On Taiyi, the above command will take a few minutes to complete. Once finished, you will see (using `ll -a`) a hidden folder `.conda` where modules got installed. To activate the environment:

```{bash, eval=F}
source activate my_mpi
```

Check `mpi4py` is properly installed by running:

```{bash, eval=F}
python -c "import mpi4py"
```

If the above command gives no error, `mpi4py` is successfully installed on your home folder.

**2.2** The `Python` script

Copy the demo files in `/work/ese-ouycc/mpi_demo/` to your home folder:

```{bash, eval=F}
cp -r /work/ese-ouycc/mpi_demo ~/mpi_demo
```

You will find a demo file `mpi_demo.py` inside, take a look at the file. 

**2.3** The submission script

You will also find a job submission file `submit_taiyi.sh` inside, take a look at the file. 

**2.4** Submit the job

To submit the MPI job to Taiyi, go to folder `mpi_demo`, type:

```{bash, eval=F}
bsub < submit_taiyi.sh
```

Using `bqueues` to check the availability of nodes, and `bjobs` to check the status of the submitted job(s).

**2.5** Check the results

Once your job is completed, take a look at `sys.log` and `job.log`. What do you get? Make sure the MPI jobs run successfully.
