# BASH scripts

## A simple BASH script

In the [Section 12](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/Section_12.html), we have covered some basic Linux commands. Now we are going to take the commands we repeat frequently and save them in files so that we can re-run all those operations again later by typing a single command. For historical reasons, a bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a *shell script*, but these are actually small programs.

Let's start by going to `data_demo/data/pdb`. Suppose we want to print line `3-8` of `menthol.pdb`, one way to do this is to run:

```{bash, eval=F}
head -n 8 menthol.pdb | tail -n 5
```

Let's copy the following line to a new file `print.sh` to create a shell script. Notice we are not running it as a command yet - we just put the commands in a file.

Once we have saved the file, we can ask the shell (BASH) to execute the commands it contains. Because our shell is called `bash`, so we run the following command:

```{bash, eval=F}
bash print.sh
```

Or change the file permission to `750`:

```{bash, eval=F}
chmod 750 print.sh
```

And then run it:

```{bash, eval=F}
./print.sh
```

As you will find, the script’s output is exactly what we would get if we ran that pipeline directly.

## A BASH script with arguments

What if we want to select lines from an arbitrary file? We could edit `print.sh` each time to change the filename, but that would probably take longer than typing the command out again in the shell and executing it with a new file name. Instead, let’s edit `print.sh` and make it more useful.

Now, replace the text `menthol.pdb` with the special variable called `$1`:

```{bash, eval=F}
head -n 8 "$1" | tail -n 5
```

Inside a shell script, `$1` means "the first filename (or argument) on the command line". We can now run our script like this:

```{bash, eval=F}
./print.sh menthol.pdb
```

Or use a different file as the argument:

```{bash, eval=F}
./print.sh pentane.pdb
```

Currently, the shell script `print.sh` takes only one argument. We can modify the script to use more command-line arguments. After the first command-line argument (`$1`), each additional argument that we provide will be accessible via the special variables `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, which refer to the first, second, third command-line arguments, respectively. For example, let's change the content of `print.sh` to be:

```{bash, eval=F}
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
```

Can you guess what it does? Check the output like:

```{bash, eval=F}
./print.sh pentane.pdb 10 2
```

So you can see that, by changing the arguments to our command, we can change our script’s behavior.

## Adding comments

The `print.sh` works fine, but it may take the next person who reads it a moment to figure out what it does. We can improve our script by adding some comments at the top:

```{bash, eval=F}
# Select lines from the middle of a file.
# Usage: bash print.sh filename end_line num_lines
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
```

A comment starts with a `#` character and runs to the end of the line. The computer ignores comments, but they’re invaluable for helping people (including yourself in the future!) understand and use scripts. Each time you modify the script, make sure you check that the comment is still accurate. An explanation that sends the reader in the wrong direction is worse than none at all.

# Running jobs on TaiYi

## Introduction to TaiYi

Open the [user manual of TaiYi](https://hpc.sustech.edu.cn/ref/cluster_User_Manual.pdf); the instructor will go over it in Chinese.

## A simple `Python` script

Here we use a simple `Python` script to demonstrate how to submit a job to TaiYi. The script goes like:

```{python, eval=F}
# Import modules
import random

# Set an integer
N = 10

# For loop with range, starting from 0
for i in range(0,N):
    temp = random.randint(0,10)
    print(temp)

# Exit with a message
print('This is done with TaiYi!')

```

Copy the above lines to a new `Python` script `t1.py`, and save it to your home directory.

## LSF job files

TaiYi uses IBM [load sharing facility (LSF)](https://hpc.sustech.edu.cn/ref/lsf_users_guide.pdf) for job management. Put is simply, you need to prepare a LSF job file that clearly describes the job, including computational resources, libraries, log files, commands, executable files, and even more options or requirements. In our case, the LSF (`job.sh`) is written as:

```{bash, eval=F}
#!/bin/sh
#BSUB -J demo     ## job name
#BSUB -q debug    ## queue name
#BSUB -n 1        ## number of total cores
#BSUB -W 00:10    ## walltime in hh:mm
#BSUB -e err.log  ## error log
#BSUB -o job.log  ## job log

# Load Python 3.7
module load python/3.7.0

# Run the script and save output to result.log
echo "--------------------"
echo "RUN t1.py:"
python3 t1.py >> result.log
```

* `#!/bin/sh` tells TaiYi this is a shell script.

* `#BSUB` stands for `bsub` with different opinions as follow:

  + `-J test` means the job name is `demo`.

  + `-q debug` means we will submit this job to the `debug` queue.

  + `-n 1` means we ask for `1` core (CPU) to run our job.
  
  + `-W 00:10` means we ask the computational resource for `00` hours and `10` minutes.
  
  + `-e err.log` means the error message (if any) will be written to `err.log`.
  
  + `-o job.log` means the job information will be written to `job.log`.

* `module load python/3.7.0` is to load `Python 3` on TaiYi.

* Finally, we run `t1.py` with `python3 t1.py`, and save the output to `result.log`.

## Job management

Submit the LSF job `job.sh` to TaiYi:

```{bash, eval=F}
bsub < job.sh
```

Once the job is submitted, it will be assigned with a job ID (e.g., `2622287`). Notice that the job may not be run immediately, depending on the availability of computational resources. You can check the status of a job with:

```{bash, eval=F}
bjobs -l <JOB ID>
```

Here `<JOB ID>` is ID of a submitted job (e.g., `2622287`).

# In-class exercises

## Exercise #1

Go to `data_demo/data/pdb`, create a shell script `count.sh` with one argument to print the total line numbers of a given file.

## Exercise #2

Write a shell script called `longest.sh` that takes the name of a directory and a filename extension as its arguments, and prints out the name of the file with the most lines in that directory with that extension.

[**Hint:** You may find `wc`, `sort`, `head`, or `tail` useful.]

## Exercise #3

Write a `Python` script `t2.py` to generate two lists of numbers and return the average of each list. Submit and run it on TaiYi.
