# Prerequisites

In this section, we will use daily data from the [AVISO](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/home.html) sea-surface height satellite altimetry dataset. Download the file (`aviso_2015.zip`, ~ `390 MB`) [from here](http://172.18.31.60/index.php/s/XjqZRXoafd9aQig), unzip it, you will have a folder (`aviso_2015`) containing `365` netcdf (nc) files. Move the folder to your working directory.

The `Jupyter Notenook` for this section is available at [here](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/download/Sup_01.ipynb).   

**Important:**  

In this section, we will use the `cper` environment you created in [Section 11](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/Section_11.html#Creating_a_Python_environment). Make sure you have it activated, and open `jupter notebook` under it, not the `base` environment.

# `Dask` for parallel computing

In past lectures, we learned how to use `numpy`, `pandas`, and `xarray` to analyze various types of data. In this section, we address an increasingly common problem: what happens if the data we wish to analyze is "big data".

A good threshold for when data becomes difficult to deal with is when the volume of data exceeds your computer's RAM (Random-access memory). Most modern laptops have between `2 GB` and `16 GB` of RAM. High-end workstations and servers can have `1 TB` or RAM or more. If the dataset you are trying to analyze can't fit in your computer's memory, some special care is required to carry out the analysis. 

The next threshold of difficulty is when the data can't fit on your hard drive. Most modern laptops have between `100 GB` and `4 TB` of storage space on the hard drive. If you can't fit your dataset on your internal hard drive, you can buy an external hard drive. However, at that point you are better off using a high-end server, HPC system, or cloud-based storage for your dataset. Once you have many `TB` of data to analyze, you are definitely in the realm of "big data". 

## Introduction to `dask`

`Dask` is a tool that helps us easily extend our familiar `Python` data analysis tools to medium and big data, *i.e.* dataset that can't fit in our computer's RAM. In many cases, `dask` also allows us to speed up our analysis by using multiple CPU cores. `Dask` can help us work more efficiently on our laptop, and it can also help us **scale up** our analysis on HPC and cloud platforms. Most importantly, `dask` is almost invisible to the user, meaning that you can focus on your science, rather than the details of parallel computing.

`Dask` provides collections for big data and a scheduler for parallel computing. In this section, we will learn the basics of using `dask` through examples. For more about `dask`, check [The Dask Documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) and [The Dask Github Site](https://github.com/dask/dask). For other modules enabling parallel computing, check [Parallel Processing and Multiprocessing in Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing).

## `Dask` arrays  

A `dask` array looks and feels a lot like a `numpy` array. However, a `dask` array doesn't directly hold any data. Instead, it **symbolically** represents the computations needed to generate the data. Nothing is actually computed until the actual numerical values are needed. This mode of operation is called *lazy*; it allows one to build up complex, large calculations symbolically before turning them over the scheduler for execution.

If we want to create a numpy array of all ones, we do it like this:  

```{python, eval=F}
# Create a numpy array
shape = (1000, 4000)
ones_np = np.ones(shape)
ones_np
```

This array contains exactly `32 MB` of data:  

```{python, eval=F}
# Check the size of array in MB
ones_np.nbytes / 1e6
```

Now let's create the same array using `dask`'s array interface:  

```{python, eval=F}
# Create a dask array
ones_da = da.ones(shape)
ones_da
```

As you see, `dask` create the array in one *chunk*. In fact, a crucial advantage with `dask` is that we can specify the `chunks` argument. Here, `chunks` describes how the array is split up over many sub-arrays. There are [several ways](https://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/array-creation.html#chunks) to specify chunks. In this section, we will use a block shape:  

```{python, eval=F}
# Specify the chunk
chunk_shape = (1000, 1000)
ones_da = da.ones(shape, chunks=chunk_shape)
ones_da
```

Notice that we just see a symbolic representation of the array, including its `shape`, `dtype`, and `chunksize`. No data has been generated yet. When we call `.compute()` on a `dask` array, the computation is trigger and the `dask` array becomes a `numpy` array.  

```{python, eval=F}
# Run computation
ones_da.compute()
```

In order to understand what happened when we called `.compute()`, you can visualize the `dask` *graph*, the symbolic operations that make up the array:

```{python, eval=F}
# Visualize the computation
ones_da.visualize()
```

As you find, the array has `4` chunks. To generate it, `dask` calls `np.ones` four times and then concatenates this together into one array.  

Rather than immediately loading a `dask` array (which puts all the data into RAM), it is more common to want to reduce the data somehow. For example:

```{python, eval=F}
# Reduce the array with sum()
sum_of_ones = ones_da.sum()

# Visualize the computation
sum_of_ones.visualize()
```

Here we see `dask`'s strategy for finding the `sum`. This simple example illustrates the beauty of `dask`: it **automatically** designs an algorithm appropriate for custom operations with big data.

## A bigger calculation

The previous example are too simple - the data (`32 MB`) is nowhere nearly big enough to warrant the use of `dask`. Let's make it a lot bigger:  

```{python, eval=F}
# A much bigger array
bigshape = (200000, 4000)

# Define the array (lazy method)
big_ones = da.ones(bigshape, chunks=chunk_shape)

# Run computation
big_ones

# Check the size of array in MB
big_ones.nbytes / 1e6
```

This dataset is `6.4 GB`! This is probably close to or greater than the amount of available RAM than you have in your computer. Nevertheless, `dask` has no problem working on it. When doing a big calculation, `dask` also has some tools to help us understand what is happening. 

```{python, eval=F}
# Import ProgressBar
from dask.diagnostics import ProgressBar

# Define the computation (lazy method)
calc = (np.cos(big_ones)**2).mean()

# Show ProgressBar
with ProgressBar():
    # Run computation
    result = calc.compute()

# Show result
result
```

In fact, all the usual `numpy` methods work on `dask` arrays. You can also apply `numpy` function directly to a `dask` array, and it will stay "lazy" until the computation starts.  

```{python, eval=F}
# Define the computation (lazy method)
calc2 = (np.exp(big_ones)**10).mean(axis=0)
calc2
```

Plotting also triggers computation, since we need the actual values.  

```{python, eval=F}
# Run computation and plot
plt.plot(calc2)
```

## Making a local client

`Dask` has several ways of executing code in parallel. We'll use the [distributed scheduler](http://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/) by creating a `dask.distributed.Client`. 

For now, this will provide us with some nice diagnostics. Let's make a local client (`my_client`) with `4` workers (`1` thread per worker):

```{python, eval=F}
# Use the distributed scheduler to form a local client (cluster)
# 4 workers, 1 thread (CPU) per worker
my_client = Client(n_workers=4, threads_per_worker=1)

# Show information of the local client
my_client.cluster
```

Click the the Dashboard link, get yourself familiarized with it.

If you no longer use a client, make sure to close your client or stop this kernel:

```{python, eval=F}
my_client.close()
```

## Parallelizing code with `dask.delayed()`

In this sub-section we parallelize some simple code with `dask` and [`dask.delayed`](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/delayed.html). Often, this is the only function that you will need to convert functions for use with `dask`. This is a simple way to use `dask` to parallelize existing codebases or build complex systems.

First let's make some toy functions, `fun1` and `fun2`, that sleep for a while to simulate work. We'll then time running these functions normally.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define two functions
def fun1(x):
    sleep(1)
    return x + 1

def fun2(x, y):
    sleep(1)
    return x + y
```

We then time the execution of this normal code using the `%%time` magic, which is a special function of the `Jupyter Notebook`.

```{python, eval=F}
%%time

# This takes three seconds to run because we call each
# function sequentially, one after the other

# Call fun1
x = fun1(1)

# Call fun1
y = fun1(2)

# Call fun2
z = fun2(x, y)
```

Those two increment calls could be called in parallel, because they are totally **independent of one-another**.

We'll transform the `fun1` and `fun2` functions using the `dask.delayed()` function. When we call the **delayed version** by passing the arguments, exactly as before, the original function isn't actually called yet - which is why the cell execution finishes very quickly. Instead, a delayed object is made, which keeps track of the function to call and the arguments to pass to it.    

```{python, eval=F}
%%time

# This runs immediately, all it does is build a graph
x = delayed(fun1)(1)
y = delayed(fun1)(2)
z = delayed(fun2)(x, y)
```

This ran immediately, since nothing has really happened yet. To get the result, call `compute`. Notice that this runs faster than the original code.

```{python, eval=F}
%%time

# This actually runs our computation using a local cluster
z.compute()
```

Here, the `z` object is a *lazy* `Delayed` object, which holds everything we need to compute the final result, including references to all of the functions that are required and their inputs and relationship to one-another. We can evaluate the result with `.compute()` as above or we can visualize the task graph for this value with `.visualize()`. As you can see, such a lazy execution allows building up complex, large calculations symbolically before turning them over to the scheduler for execution. For more, check [`dask` delayed execution](https://tutorial.dask.org/03_dask.delayed.html).

```{python, eval=F}
# Look at the task graph for z
z.visualize()
```

Notice that this includes the names of the functions from before, and the logical flow of the outputs of the `fun1` functions to the inputs of `fun2`.

## Parallelizing a `for` loop with `dask.delayed()`

`for` loops are one of the most common things that we want to parallelize. Use `dask.delayed `on `fun1` and `sum` to parallelize the computation below:

```{python, eval=F}
# Make a simple list
data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

```{python, eval=F}
%%time

# Sequential code
results = []

# Loop element one by one
for i in data:
    temp = fun1(i)
    results.append(temp)

# Compute
total = sum(results)

# After it's computed
print("After computing :", total)  
```

A parallel version with `dask.delayed()` would be:

```{python, eval=F}
%%time

# Parallel code 
results = []

for i in data:
    temp = delayed(fun1)(i)
    results.append(temp)

# Define the method
total = delayed(sum)(results)

# Let's see what type of thing total is
print("Before computing:", total)

# Compute
result = total.compute()

# After it's computed
print("After computing :", result) 
```

Visualize the task graph for this:

```{python, eval=F}
# Look at the task graph for total
total.visualize()
```

Now enlarge `data` to a larger list, *e.g*, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. Check what would happen to the running time of `total`? Can you figure out why?

## Combing `dask` and `xarray`

`Xarray` can automatically wrap its data in [`dask` arrays](https://tutorial.dask.org/02_array.html). This capability turns `xarray` into an extremely powerful tool for Big Data earth science. 

To illustrate this in action, we will use a fairly large dataset to analyze. This file contains `1` year of daily data from the [AVISO](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/home.html) sea-surface height satellite altimetry dataset. 

Let's load the first file as a regular `xarray` dataset:

```{python, eval=F}
# Load the first file with xarray
ds_first = xr.open_dataset('aviso_2015/dt_global_allsat_madt_h_20150101_20150914.nc')

# Check the data
ds_first
```

This one file is about `8 MB`. So `365` of them will be nearly `3 GB`. If we had downloaded all `25` years of data, it would be `73 GB`!. This is a good example of "medium data".

With [`open_mfdataset`](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.open_mfdataset.html), we can easily open all the netcdf files into one *Dataset* object. 

```{python, eval=F}
# Use open_mfdataset to load all the nc files
ds = xr.open_mfdataset('aviso_2015/*.nc')

# Check data object
# Notice that the values are not displayed
ds
```

Note that the values are not displayed, since that would trigger computation.

```{python, eval=F}
# Get sea surface height (adt)
ssh = ds.adt

# Check the data, this is a dask array
ssh
```

Try the following code, see what happens:

```{python, eval=F}
# Compute annual mean ssh
ssh_2015_mean = ssh.mean(dim='time')
```

To actually compute the data:

```{python, eval=F}
# Compute annual mean ssh
ssh_2015_mean.load()

# Plot annual mean
ssh_2015_mean.plot()
```

Finally, close the client (local cluster):

```{python, eval=F}
# Close the client (local cluster)
my_client.close()
```
